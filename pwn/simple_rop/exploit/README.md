1. **Buffer Overflow:** Exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability by providing an excessively long input, overwriting the program's memory to control the RIP.

2. **Return-to-libc Attack:** Alter the *RIP* to perform a *Return-to-libc* attack. Instead of executing arbitrary shellcode, use existing libc functions to achieve the desired result.

3. **Leaking Addresses:** Utilize repeated calls to `gets` to leak addresses of various *libc* functions like `gets`, `puts`, `setvbuf`, etc. This information helps in identifying the base address of the libc.

4. **Identifying libc Version:** Use online databases or tools to cross-reference leaked *libc* function addresses with different *libc* versions.

5. **Exploiting `system` function:** After determining the base address of the libc, craft a payload that uses the leaked addresses to calculate the offset for the system function. Then construct an exploit that uses this offset to call system with the desired command.

6. **Bonus Challenge (Optional):** For those seeking an extra challenge, use [one_gadget](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget) to perform the exploit, a single gadget that provides a chain of instructions to achieve arbitrary code execution without needing to calculate the system function's offset.


Terminology:
 - RIP: IP, short for "Instruction Pointer," refers to a register in the x86-64 architecture that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. Manipulating the RIP allows attackers to control the program's execution flow, enabling exploitation techniques like buffer overflows, return-oriented programming (ROP), and other attacks aimed at redirecting the execution sequence.
